# Email Spam Detection Project

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning-based email spam detection system using TensorFlow's Sequential Model API. It classifies emails as either spam or not spam (ham) based on their content.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is the **Spambase Dataset**, which contains labeled email messages as spam or ham. It consists of 4,601 instances with 57 features each. These features represent various characteristics of the email such as word frequencies, characters, and other attributes.

You can find the dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bRuM2RJ3CGD5_PtnIr7jVbC5kOJW5o6x)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Meghsss/Email_Spam_Classifier.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd Email_Spam_Classifier
   ```
   
3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```


## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing for email spam detection involves cleaning and transforming the raw email text data into a format that can be used for training a machine learning model. Here's a detailed definition of the steps involved in data preprocessing for this task:

1. **Lowercasing**: Convert all text to lowercase to ensure consistency and remove case sensitivity.

2. **Tokenization**: Split the text into individual words or tokens. This step is essential for further analysis as it breaks down the text into smaller units.

3. **Removing Punctuation and Non-Alphanumeric Characters**: Remove any punctuation marks and non-alphanumeric characters from the text. Punctuation marks do not contribute significantly to the classification task and can be safely removed.

4. **Stopword Removal**: Remove common stopwords from the text. Stopwords are common words like "and," "the," "is," etc., that do not carry much meaning and can be safely ignored during analysis.

5. **Stemming or Lemmatization**: Reduce words to their root form to normalize the text. This step helps in reducing the dimensionality of the feature space by combining words with similar meanings.

6. **Vectorization**: Convert the preprocessed text into numerical vectors using techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings. This step transforms the text data into a format that machine learning algorithms can process.

7. **Train-Test Split**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the machine learning model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.

By performing these preprocessing steps, we can effectively clean and transform the raw email text data into a suitable format for training a spam detection model.

2. **Model Training**: Model training refers to the process of teaching a machine learning model to recognize patterns and make predictions based on input data. In the context of our email spam detection project, model training involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare the preprocessed email text data along with their corresponding labels (spam or not spam) for training. This includes features (text data) and target labels (binary classification labels).

2. **Model Selection**: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm or model architecture for the task. In our project, we are using a TensorFlow Sequential model, but other algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or ensemble methods like Random Forest can also be considered.

3. **Model Compilation**: Compile the selected model by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics. For binary classification tasks like spam detection, common choices include the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.

4. **Model Training**: Train the compiled model using the prepared training data. During training, the model learns to adjust its internal parameters (weights and biases) to minimize the loss function and improve its predictive performance.

5. **Evaluation**: After training, evaluate the performance of the trained model on a separate validation or test dataset. Common evaluation metrics for binary classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

6. **Fine-tuning**: Optionally, fine-tune the model hyperparameters or architecture to optimize its performance further. This may involve adjusting parameters like learning rate, batch size, or adding regularization techniques like dropout to prevent overfitting.

By following these steps, we can train a machine learning model to effectively classify emails as spam or not spam based on their content. The trained model can then be deployed and used to automatically filter incoming emails in real-time.


## Model Architecture

The model architecture consists of a sequential stack of dense layers. Each dense layer is followed by a ReLU activation function and dropout regularization to prevent overfitting.

```python
model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(57,)),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```

## Results

The trained model achieves an accuracy of around 95% on the test set, indicating its effectiveness in classifying spam and ham emails.
